outcome:

Except drugs and possession of weapons all othercrime types the closure rate is above 90%.

and  90% of closed cases they couldnt able to find a suspect or couldnot able to prosecute,in rrecent months if we notice cases are closing without finding suspect.

Looking at the crime type by closed status in drugs and possession of weapons crime catogiry more suspect received punishment compare to other crime types.

Police department able to close majority of the cases on paper but the prosecutor get punished are very less.

Due to this the suspects could be repeating the crime or more new .
